Desk.com Example App For QlikView
=================================
An example application showing how to get started using the [QVSource General Web Connector](http://wiki.qvsource.com/General-Web-Connector-For-QlikView.ashx) for QlikView configured for the Desk.com API. We have some 'work in progress' documentation [here](http://wiki.qvsource.com/Desk-Connector-For-QlikView.ashx).

The application simply connects to Desk.com API and pages through all your entries.

If you are a QlikView + QVSource user you can simply click the ["Download ZIP"] (https://github.com/QVSource/QVSource-Desk.com-Example-For-QlikView/archive/master.zip) button on GitHub to grab this application.
